# How long has this been going on?

Since coronavirus-related disruptions have interrupted all aspects of every day life, itâ€™s been hard to keep track of time. 
This app counts the days that have elapsed from certain events to today. It uses the svelte framework and the [World Time API](https://worldtimeapi.org/) 
to get the current time (as this is a Minnesota-focused project, all times are for the Central U.S. time zone).

## Installing
Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd minnpost-how-long
npm install
```

## Run locally for development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```

Then copy the files in the `/public/build/` folders to the relevant S3 or directory or other hosting solution.
